  abstract = {The efficiency of the conversion of photosynthetically active radiation by C3 plants falls off with increasing intensity. Hypothesis: an increase in the productivity of direct solar energy will be achieved if, by redistribution, it is intercepted at a more uniform and lower intensity by a greater proportion of the leaf area of a crop. A model is developed which uses estimates of the proportions of clear and overcast conditions from site records of solar radiation to calculate the resultant photosynthetic productivity. The amounts of diffuse light and direct light are estimated for clear conditions. The model predicts that redistributing direct solar radiation over twice the leaf area at half the intensity would give an increase of 22\% in annual productivity. The model gives reasonable values for the productivity reductions reported for two shading regimes.Tomato plants were grown for 21 d in three cabinets under regimes that differed from each other only in the distribution of PAR energy over the daily photoperiod: (a) 103 W m-2 for half the photoperiod followed by 13 W m-2, (b) 13 W m-2 followed by 103 W m-2 and (c) 58 W m-2 for the whole photoperiod. The dry matter increase of plants under the uniform regime was 33\% greater than the average of those in the two asymmetric regimes.It is suggested that, in protected cultivation, screens of partially reflective material could be used to redistribute solar radiation from leaves exposed to high intensities on to shaded leaves and so raise the photosynthetic efficiency. Assuming an absorption of direct light by the screens of 0.10, the increase in productivity is estimated to be 17\%.},

Along with the rising dust loads, total chlorophyll and net photosynthetic rate had logarithmic droppings, from 1.37 {$\pm$} 0.10 to 0.42 {$\pm$} 0.03 mg/g and from 9.87 {$\pm$} 0.18 to 5.69 {$\pm$} 0.69 \textmu mol/m2/s, respectively. The root-shoot ratio of biomass logarithmically increased between 2.17 {$\pm$} 0.51 and 2.73 {$\pm$} 0.21. The height increments had a linear decline between 3.8 {$\pm$} 1.0 and 1.5 {$\pm$} 0.2 cm. Gas exchange parameters decreased fast in the initial dusting time and then reduced slowly or even increased. When dusted with the maximum foliar dust load of Beijing's street trees for 21 days, photosynthetic performance of S. japonica would decrease by 16\%; height increment of S. japonica would decrease by 17\%. Leaf biomass decline caused by dust might be a potential risk for street trees. Using plants like S. japonica as street trees or other green spaces could be a good measure to mitigate PM pollution.},

Clonally produced grass and forb ramets comprised {$>$}99\%of all established shoots present at the end of the growing season, whereas established seedlings accounted for {$<$}1\%,emphasizing the rarity of successful seedling establishment and the importance of vegetative reproduction in driving the annual regeneration and dynamics of aboveground plant populations in tallgrass prairie. Most recruitment from vegetative reproduction occurred early in the growing season and was higher in annually burned than infrequently burned sites, although low levels of new stem recruitment occurred continuously throughout the growing season. Peak recruitment on annually burned prairie coincided with peak recruitment of the dominant C4 grasses Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans prior to prescribed spring fire, with a second peak in recruitment occurring following fire. On infrequently burned prairie, grass and forb recruitment was highest in early April and declined steadily through May. The naturalized C3 grass, Poa pratensis, was responsible for most of the early recruitment on unburned sites, whereas A. gerardii contributed most to recruitment later in May. Infrequently burned prairie was dominated by these two grasses and contained a larger forb component than annually burned prairie. The principal demographic effect of fire was on ramet natality rather than mortality. Fire regime, plant functional group, or timing of cohort emergence before or after fire did not affect ramet survivorship. C4 grass shoots that emerged early and were damaged by fire showed similar survivorship patterns to tillers that emerged after fire. Differences in species composition between annually burned and infrequently burned prairie are driven by fire effects on vegetative reproduction and appear to be related principally to the effect of fire and detritus accumulation on the development of belowground vegetative meristems of C4 grasses and their emergence dynamics.},

A portion of the energy extraction in the Bakken occurs in the wetland rich Prairie Pothole Region, and there is little information on gravel road dust emissions or the ecological impacts. The objectives of this study were to (1) estimate surface loading of gravel road dust during different times of year and at different distances from the road, (2) evaluate dust loading effects on surface water quality, and (3) evaluate the impact of dust deposition on wetland soils. Ten wetlands were tested in the energy impacted area and ten in an adjacent area without energy development. There was a 355 \% increase in dust loading 10 m from the road in the energy impacted area compared to an area without energy development; meanwhile, there was only a 46 \% increase in dust loading 40 m from the road. This loading resulted in an annual deposition of 647 g/m2 of gravel road dust close to the road. However, the effect of dust loading on the water quality and soils of wetlands was minimal when compared to wetlands not impacted by increased gravel road dust. The finding of minimal effect on wetland resources from increased road dust fills a knowledge gap in the Bakken on how energy development alters the environment.},

We investigated the effects of a novel granite dust product as an agent for controlling two-spotted spider mites, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), on tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Two-choice tests for repellency and repulsiveness, and no-choice bioassays with different type of applications (soil, foliar, and soil\textendash foliar) were used in order to evaluate performance and action of the product. Evaluation of epidermal micromorphology and mesophyll structure of treated plants and elemental analyses of leaves were performed. In repulsiveness experiments, almost all dust treatments significantly inhibited mites from migrating to and/or settling on the treated leaf. In repellency experiments, foliar and soil dust treatments were not significantly different from control. Significant mortality was observed for all dust treatments in two-choice and in no-choice bioassays, suggesting mites are susceptible to rock dust by contact, and by indirect interaction through the feeding on plants subjected to soil application of rock dust. Leaf epidermal micromorphology and mesophyll structure of treated plants showed structural variation due to mineral accumulation, which was also confirmed by elemental analyses of leaves. These results demonstrate for the first time that granite rock dust interacts with two-spotted spider mites by modifying pest behavior and via acaricidal action, providing more insights in understanding the mechanism of this novel natural product as pest management tool.},

To bridge this disciplinary gap, we provide a general overview of the ecological importance of dust, examine complex interactions between wind erosion and ecosystem dynamics from the scale of plants and surrounding space to regional and global scales, and highlight specific examples of how disturbance affects these interactions and their consequences. It is likely that changes in climate and intensification of land use will lead to increased dust production from many drylands. To address these issues, environmental scientists, land managers, and policy makers need to consider wind erosion and dust emissions more explicitly in resource management decisions.},

To understand the physiological basis of this progress and possibly assist future selection for grain yield, leaf traits were determined during 3 yr in the same study. Stomatal conductance (gs), maximum photosynthetic rate (Amax, and canopy temperature depression (CTD), averaged over the 3 yr, were closely and positively correlated with progress in the 6-yr mean yield. The correlation was greatest with gs (r = 0.94, P {$<$} 0.01). Compared with the overall yield increase of 27\%, gs increased 63\%, Amax increased 23\%, and canopies were 0.6\textdegree C cooler. Carbon-13 isotope discrimination was also positively associated with yield progress (r = 0.71, P {$<$} 0.05), but other leaf traits such as flag leaf area, specific leaf weight, percentage N and greeness were not, nor was crop growth rate around anthesis. The causal basis of the leaf activity interrelationships is reasonably clear, with both increased intercellular CO2 concentration and increased mesophyll activity contributing to the increase in Amax. However, causal links to the yield progress, and the accompanying increase in kernels per square meter, are not clear. It is concluded that gs and CTD should be further investigated as potential indirect selection criteria for yield.},

The sample archive dates to 2004 and is currently the largest known record of field-scale dust emissions for the southwestern United States. Sediment flux peaked during the spring months in all plant communities (mean: 38.1gm-2d-1), related to higher, sustained wind speeds that begin in the early spring. Dust flux was lowest during the winter period (mean: 5gm-2d-1) when surface wind speeds are typically low. Sites dominated by blackbrush and sagebrush shrubs had higher sediment flux (mean: 19.4gm-2d-1) compared to grasslands (mean: 11.2gm-2d-1), saltbush shrublands (mean: 10.3gm-2d-1), and woodlands (mean: 8.1gm-2d-1). Contrary to other studies on dust emissions, antecedent precipitation during one, two, and three seasons prior to sample collection did not significantly influence emission rates. Physical site-scale factors controlling dust emissions were complex and varied from one vegetation type to another.},

  abstract = {There is a long-standing controversy as to whether drought limits photosynthetic CO2 assimilation through stomatal closure or by metabolic impairment in C3 plants. Comparing results from different studies is difficult due to interspecific differences in the response of photosynthesis to leaf water potential and/or relative water content (RWC), the most commonly used parameters to assess the severity of drought. Therefore, we have used stomatal conductance (g) as a basis for comparison of metabolic processes in different studies. The logic is that, as there is a strong link between g and photosynthesis (perhaps co-regulation between them), so different relationships between RWC or water potential and photosynthetic rate and changes in metabolism in different species and studies may be `normalized' by relating them to g. Re-analysing data from the literature using light-saturated g as a parameter indicative of water deficits in plants shows that there is good correspondence between the onset of drought-induced inhibition of different photosynthetic sub-processes and g. Contents of ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) decrease early in drought development, at still relatively high g (higher than 150~mmol H2O m\textendash 2 s\textendash 1). This suggests that RuBP regeneration and ATP synthesis are impaired. Decreased photochemistry and Rubisco activity typically occur at lower g (\&lt;100~mmol H2O m\textendash 2 s\textendash 1), whereas permanent photoinhibition is only occasional, occurring at very low g (\&lt;50~mmol H2O m\textendash 2 s\textendash 1). Sub-stomatal CO2 concentration decreases as g becomes smaller, but increases again at small g. The analysis suggests that stomatal closure is the earliest response to drought and the dominant limitation to photosynthesis at mild to moderate drought. However, in parallel, progressive down-regulation or inhibition of metabolic processes leads to decreased RuBP content, which becomes the dominant limitation at severe drought, and thereby inhibits photosynthetic CO2 assimilation.},

It was found that dust decreased stomatal conductance in the light, and increased it in the dark by plugging the stomata, when the stomata were open during dusting. When dust of smaller particles was applied, the effect was greater. However, the effect was negligible when the stomata were closed during dusting. The dust decreased the photosynthetic rate by shading the leaf surface. The dust of smaller particles had a greater shading effect. Moreover, it was found that the additional absorption of incident radiation by the dust increased the leaf temperature, and consequently changed the photosynthetic rate in accordance with its response curve to leaf temperature. The increase in leaf temperature also increased the transpiration rate.},

The frequency, duration and severity of heat and drought stress events are predicted to increase in the future, having severe implications for agricultural productivity and food security. To assess the impact on plant gas exchange, physiology and morphology we grew drought tolerant and sensitive varieties of C3 sunflower (Helianthus annuus) and C4 maize (Zea mays) under conditions of elevated temperature for 4 weeks prior to the imposition of water deficit. The negative impact of temperature on PN was most apparent in sunflower. The drought tolerant sunflower retained ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) activity under heat stress to a greater extent than its drought sensitive counterpart. Maize exhibited no varietal difference in response to increased temperature. In contrast to previous studies, where a sudden rise in temperature induced an increase in stomatal conductance (Gs), we observed no change or a reduction in Gs with elevated temperature, which alongside lower leaf area mitigated the impact of drought at the higher temperature. The drought tolerant sunflower and maize varieties exhibited greater investment in root-systems, allowing greater uptake of the available soil water. Elevated temperatures associated with heat-waves will have profound negative impacts on crop growth in both sunflower and maize, but the deleterious effect on PN was less apparent in the drought tolerant sunflower and both maize varieties. As C4 plants generally exhibit water use efficiency (WUE) and resistance to heat stress, selection on the basis of tolerance to heat and drought stress would be more beneficial to the yields of C3 crops cultivated in drought prone semi-arid regions.},

But the photosynthetic systems do not adapt to fluctuating light conditions as rapidly as a cloud passes overhead, resulting in suboptimal photosynthetic efficiency. Kromdijk et al. sped up the adaptation process by accelerating interconversion of violaxanthin and zeaxanthin in the xanthophyll cycle and by increasing amounts of a photosystem II subunit. Tobacco plants tested with this system showed about 15\% greater plant biomass production in natural field conditions.Science, this issue p. 857Crop leaves in full sunlight dissipate damaging excess absorbed light energy as heat. When sunlit leaves are shaded by clouds or other leaves, this protective dissipation continues for many minutes and reduces photosynthesis. Calculations have shown that this could cost field crops up to 20\% of their potential yield. Here, we describe the bioengineering of an accelerated response to natural shading events in Nicotiana (tobacco), resulting in increased leaf carbon dioxide uptake and plant dry matter productivity by about 15\% in fluctuating light. Because the photoprotective mechanism that has been altered is common to all flowering plants and crops, the findings provide proof of concept for a route to obtaining a sustainable increase in productivity for food crops and a much-needed yield jump.},

Seasonal (winter/spring) dust mass fluxes to the San Juan Mountains during the period from 2004 to 2008 ranged from 5 to 10 g m?2, with individual deposition events reaching as high as 2 g m?2. Dust deposited in the San Juan Mountains was primarily composed of silt- and clay-sized particles, indicating a regional source area. The concentrations of most major and minor elements in this dust were similar to or less than average upper continental crustal concentrations, whereas trace element concentrations were often enriched. In particular, dust collected from the San Juan Mountain snowpack was characterized by enrichments of heavy metals including As, Cu, Cd, Mo, Pb, and Zn. The mineral composition of dust partially explained dust geochemistry; however, based on results of a sequential leaching procedure it appeared that trace element enrichments were associated with the organic-, and not the mineral-, fraction of dust. Our observations show that the dust-derived fluxes of several nutrients and trace metals are substantial and, because many elements are deposited in a mobile form, could be important controls of vegetation, soil, or surface water chemistry. The flux measurements reported here are useful benchmarks for the characterization of ecosystem biogeochemical cycling in the Rocky Mountains.},

Consequently, it is common for environmental regulatory agencies to apply vegetation monitoring requirements to oil, gas and mining developments. We use two independent, medium-term monitoring studies in semi-arid Australia to examine this relationship at two scales: plant health and survivorship of a threatened subspecies (Tetratheca paynterae paynterae: Elaeocarpaceae) at Windarling Range between 2003 and 2014; and changes in plant health and floristic composition on Barrow Island between 2009 and 2014. Accumulation of dust decreased rapidly with distance from source. At Windarling Range, even at the site with the highest dust load, there was no significant impact on Tetratheca paynterae paynterae compared with the less dusty sites for 10\,years. Similarly, there was no significant effect between distance from the source of dust and floristic composition on Barrow Island for 5\,years. The probability of plants transitioning to a lower health condition between one year and the next did not appear to be related to dust load. This is further supported by comparing the same site before and after paving the road (removal of dust source), which showed no clear trends. Trends in plant health are likely to be driven more by the variability of cumulative rainfall in the preceding 5\,months than dust load. The observed temporal variation in the mean dust load may also be related to variation in rainfall. In conclusion, in these case studies from semi-arid Australia, we find no evidence to support the perception that, under the observed climatic condition and dust deposition rates up to 20 or 77\,g\,m-2 per month at Windarling Range and Barrow Island, respectively, dust accumulation on plants causes negative impacts.},

In a growth chamber, we compared crude protein content, biomass recovery and total crude protein across a set of perennial C3 and C4 grasses from the northern U.S. Great Plains under elevated [CO2] and simulated drought. Simulated 95\% confidence intervals indicate both C3 and C4 grasses increased forage quality and quantity under elevated [CO2]. C4 grasses were generally resistant to water limitation while forage quality and quantity of C3 grasses declined under simulated drought. Our results are consistent with literature on forage quantity responses to elevated [CO2] and drought, but forage quality responses contradict expectations. We suggest measuring plant functional traits might better elucidate response mechanisms and ameliorate methodological differences even if traits are not directly applicable to grazing management.},

We focus on two elements of climate change: elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, or e[CO2], and reduced water availability, as caused by drought. Both variables have been shown to have effects on crop physiology, although there is considerable evidence of interactions and moderation by species-specific differences. Measuring traits helps scale environmental effects up to functional responses, and we focused on traits connected to photosynthesis, which has a close association with crop yield. We measured the response of four physiological traits\textemdash quantum photosynthetic yield, chlorophyll content, root:shoot ratio and leaf area\textemdash across a diverse set of seven annual crop species grown under three levels of e[CO2] (450, 575 and 700 ppm) and two levels of water availability (minimum {$\sim$}45 and {$\sim$}15\% VWC) in a growth chamber. Species included barley, durum wheat, maize, oats, sorghum, pinto bean and sunflower. Our regression analysis focused on testing for interactions between e[CO2] and water limitation and determining relative effect sizes of climate change impacts across species, data that can be used for species-specific modeling or determining appropriate levels of environmental variables in free-air CO2 enrichment studies designed to extend small-scale experimental results to the field. Across all species and all traits, the strongest effect of e[CO2] occurred from 450 to 575 ppm, with only marginal differences from 575 to 700 ppm. We found substantial declines in leaf area across all species as a result of e[CO2] and wide variability in leaf area responses to water limitation. Other traits showed weak and variable responses to both e[CO2] and water limitation. While our data confirm that elements of global change, especially increased atmospheric CO2 concentration, do affect traits related to photosynthesis, we found no discernible pattern to suggest which crops might be more resistant to e[CO2].},

We measured growth analysis parameters, leaf net photosynthesis (Pn), chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, conductance to water vapor (gl) and water potential ({$\Psi$}), to provide explanations for differences in biomass production under these treatments. Under high water availability, E- plants produced more biomass and had greater relative growth rates (RGR; rate of biomass gain per biomass); higher RGR of E- plants was correlated with higher Pn as well as production of less dense, presumably thinner leaves, which provided more leaf area per leaf biomass, and greater LAR (leaf area ratio; leaf area per total plant biomass). Under low water availability, E+ plants produced more aboveground biomass and had greater RGR; higher RGR of E+ plants was correlated with higher net assimilation rates, as well as production of less dense leaves and greater LAR. Infected plants tended to have lower midday Pn and gl in both water availability regimes. Lower Pn in E+ plants appeared primarily due to stomatal, rather than biochemical, limitations to photosynthesis. When a more severe water stress was imposed in the low water availability treatment over the last 61 days of the experiment, E+ plants tended to have higher midday Pn and gl. Infected plants also tended to have less negative leaf {$\Psi$} regardless of water availability regime. Lower gl and transpirational losses of E+ plants probably conserved soil moisture, such that when a more severe water stress was subsequently imposed, higher soil moisture availability allowed E+ plants to maintain higher Pn and gl. Neotyphodium infection appears beneficial to Arizona fescue performance under low water availability and detrimental under ample water availability.},

Maximum rates of net photosynthesis (A) of dusted organs were reduced to 21 \% of those of control plants in resinous leaflets of Larrea, to 44\% in resinous leaves and photosynthetic stems of Hymenoclea, and to 58\% in non-resinous C4 leaves of Atriplex, which have vesiculated trichomes. Dusted plants of all three species showed reduced maximum leaf conductance (gs), transpiration (E) and instantaneous wateruse efficiency (A/E). Intrinsic water-use efficiency (A/gs) was also reduced, except in Atriplex, in which it remained unchanged. 3. Temperatures of dusted leaves and photosynthetic stems were 2-3 'C higher than those of control plants, due to greater absorptance of infra-red radiation. Dust also significantly increased photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) reflectance.},

Important unresolved research questions are identified for each area of risk; however, certain domains exhibit especially acute deficits of knowledge and attention, including integrated studies of public health, ecosystems, air quality, socioeconomic impacts on communities, and climate change. For these, current research and analysis are insufficient to either confirm or preclude important impacts. The rapidly evolving landscape of shale gas governance in the U.S. is also assessed, noting challenges and opportunities associated with the current decentralized (state-focused) system of regulation. We briefly review emerging approaches to shale gas governance in other nations, and consider new governance initiatives and options in the U.S. involving voluntary industry certification, comprehensive development plans, financial instruments, and possible future federal roles. In order to encompass the multiple relevant disciplines, address the complexities of the evolving shale gas system and reduce the many key uncertainties needed for improved management, a coordinated multiagency federal research effort will need to be implemented.},

We used dust collectors, trail cameras, and sweep-netting at increasing distances from unpaved roads to determine dust deposition, relative bird abundance, and invertebrate abundance, respectively. We found that traffic associated with fracking along unpaved roads emitted substantial dust 180~m into adjacent crop fields. But neither bird abundance or behavior, nor invertebrate abundance or community composition, appeared to be affected by dust or traffic. These findings suggest that wildlife in previously intensified agricultural landscapes like crop fields are resilient to intensification from energy development, but the same might not be true for wildlife in previously undisturbed habitat.},

Little is known about such effects, however, despite more general interest in ecological effects of dust.Methodology.?We used observational and experimental methods to explore whether dust generated by traffic on unpaved roads affects the amounts of pollen received and numbers of seeds produced by four species of native wildflowers in the western United States.Pivotal results.?Flowers of Nuttall?s larkspur (Delphinium nuttallianum), scarlet gilia (Ipomopsis aggregata), Lewis flax (Linum lewisii), and sulphur paintbrush (Castilleja sulphurea) growing 1?2 m from a road received substantially more dust and less pollen than those growing 40?50 m away. We observed the same pattern when we transplanted individuals of the first two species into pots and placed pots near to compared with far from a road. Experimental ?hand dusting? of scarlet gilia and Lewis flax plants also reduced stigma pollen loads to a degree that resembled the average effect of road proximity for those species. On the other hand, numbers of seeds per flower (?seed set?) did not vary consistently for any species as a function of road proximity or hand-dusting treatment.Conclusions.?Several mechanisms might contribute to the different effects of dust on pollen loads and seed set. We discuss four possible mechanisms, which we refer to as pollen excess, pollen quality, resource limitation, and compensatory herbivory. These mechanisms suggest avenues for further study of dust, pollination, and plant reproduction with this and other systems.},

  abstract = {Fugitive road dust collection for chemical analysis and interpretation has been limited by the quantity and representativeness of samples. Traditional methods of fugitive dust collection generally focus on point-collections that limit data interpretation to a small area or require the investigator to make gross assumptions about the origin of the sample collected. These collection methods often produce a limited quantity of sample that may hinder efforts to characterize the samples by multiple geochemical techniques, preserve a reference archive, and provide a spatially integrated characterization of the road dust health hazard. To achieve a "better sampling" for fugitive road dust studies, a cyclonic fugitive dust (CFD) sampler was constructed and tested. Through repeated and identical sample collection routes at two collection heights (50.8 and 88.9 cm above the road surface), the products of the CFD sampler were characterized using particle size and chemical analysis. The average particle size collected by the cyclone was 17.9 mu m, whereas particles collected by a secondary filter were 0.625 mu m. No significant difference was observed between the two sample heights tested and duplicates collected at the same height; however, greater sample quantity was achieved at 50.8 cm above the road surface than at 88.9 cm. The cyclone effectively removed 94\% of the particles {$>$} 1 mm, which substantially reduced the loading on the secondary filter used to collect the finer particles; therefore, suction is maintained for longer periods of time, allowing for an average sample collection rate of about 2 g mi(-1).},

The variation characteristics of reflectance spectra of E. japonicus and foliar dust content were noted, and the differences of leaf reflectance and first derivative spectrum between leaves with and without dust were analyzed. The correlation between foliar dust content and leaf spectral reflectance was established. The results suggest that foliar dust increased the reflectance in specific ranges of the visible light spectrum, decreased the reflectance at near infrared regions, and had no change in red edge position, blue edge slope, yellow and blue edge area. Furthermore, the yellow edge position and yellow edge slope were decreased, the blue edge position and red edge slope and red edge area were increased. This research calculated leaf surface dust content inversion models, with the model fitting only within spectral parameters and foliar dust content. This study led to the discovery that the fitting index of the area of red edge as a variable is relatively high, and grading the foliar dust content to obtain a variety of model fitting with four spectral parameters enabled the conclusion that model (2) is the final relatively good inversion model of E. japonicus foliar dust content. ``Project supported by Central Public Welfare Research Institute of basic research funds (CAFYBB2014MA006)''.},

While emphasis was on studying the impacts of industrial dust particles on crop development, the effect of natural dust deposition on the physiological parameters of cotton had not been studied before. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of dust deposits on cotton leaves and to estimate their impact on crop development and yield. For this purpose, an experiment was set up having two treatments and a control. In Treatment 1, cotton leaves were cleaned with water at three-day intervals or after a natural dust fall. In Treatment 2,  100 g{$\cdot$}m-2 of dust was applied at 10-day intervals. The control received neither additional dust nor cleaning. In all of the treatments, stomatal conductance, leaf temperature, biomass and yield were measured. The results show a 28\% reduction in yield and 30\% reduction in stomatal conductance of the dust treatment compared to the control treatment. This indicates blocking of the stomata on the top of the leaf surface. In addition, the canopy temperature of the dust-applied leaves was always higher than the control and treatment.},
